Laptop
======
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/18F/laptop.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/18F/laptop)

Laptop is a script to set up an OS X computer for web development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

Requirements
------------

We support:

* [OS X Yosemite (10.10)](https://www.apple.com/osx/)
* OS X Mavericks (10.9)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

Install
-------

Begin by opening the Terminal application on your Mac. The easiest way to open
an application in OS X is to search for it via [Spotlight]. The default
keyboard shortcut for invoking Spotlight is `command-Space`. Once Spotlight
is up, just start typing the first few letters of the app you are looking for,
and once it appears, press `return` to launch it.

In your Terminal window, copy and paste each of these two commands one at a
time, then press `return` after each one to download and execute the
script, respectively:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IgorMarques/laptop/master/mac
bash mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```
The [script](https://github.com/IgorMarques/laptop/blob/master/mac) itself is
available in this repo for you to review if you want to see what it does
and how it works.

Note that the script will ask you to enter your OS X password at various
points. This is the same password that you use to log in to your Mac.
If you don't already have it installed, GitHub for Mac will launch
automatically at the end of the script so you can set up everything you'll
need to push code to GitHub.

Once the script is done, make sure to quit and relaunch Terminal.

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`. Read through it to see if
you can debug the issue yourself. If not, copy the lines where the script
failed into a [new GitHub
Issue](https://github.com/18F/laptop/issues/new) for us. Or, attach the
whole log file as an attachment.

What it sets up
---------------

* [GitHub for Mac] for setting up your SSH keys automatically
* [Homebrew] for managing operating system libraries
* [Homebrew Cask] for quickly installing Mac apps from the command line
* [Homebrew Services] so you can easily stop, start, and restart services
* [ImageMagick] for cropping and resizing images
* [MySQL] for storing relational data
* [Node.js] and [NPM], for running apps and installing JavaScript packages
* [Postgres] for storing relational data
* [Python 3] for programming software and data analysis
* [Qt] for headless JavaScript testing via Capybara Webkit
* [Redis] for storing key-value data
* [RVM] for managing Ruby versions (includes [Bundler] and the latest [Ruby])
* [Zsh] as your shell

[Bundler]: http://bundler.io/
[GitHub for Mac]: https://mac.github.com/
[Homebrew]: http://brew.sh/
[Homebrew Cask]: http://caskroom.io/
[Homebrew Services]: https://github.com/gapple/homebrew-services
[ImageMagick]: http://www.imagemagick.org/
[MySQL]: https://www.mysql.com/
[Node.js]: http://nodejs.org/
[NPM]: https://www.npmjs.org/
[Postgres]: http://www.postgresql.org/
[Python 3]: https://www.python.org/
[Qt]: http://qt-project.org/
[Redis]: http://redis.io/
[Ruby]: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/
[RVM]: https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm
[Zsh]: http://www.zsh.org/

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (depends on your machine and
internet connection).

Customize in `~/.laptop.local`
------------------------------

Your `~/.laptop.local` is run at the end of the `mac` script.
Put your customizations there. This repo already contains a `.laptop.local`
you can use to get started. It lets you install the following tools
(commented out by default):

* [Atom] - GitHub's open source text editor
* [Exuberant Ctags] for indexing files for vim tab completion
* [Firefox] for testing your website on a browser other than Chrome
* [iTerm2] - an awesome replacement for the OS X Terminal
* [reattach-to-user-namespace] to allow copy and paste from Tmux
* [Tmux] for saving project state and switching between projects
* [Vim] for those who prefer the command line

[Atom]: https://atom.io/
[Exuberant Ctags]: http://ctags.sourceforge.net/
[Firefox]: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/
[iTerm2]: http://iterm2.com/
[reattach-to-user-namespace]: https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard
[Tmux]: http://tmux.sourceforge.net/
[Vim]: http://www.vim.org/

For example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# brew_cask_install 'atom'
# brew_cask_install 'firefox'
brew_cask_install 'iterm2'

# brew_install_or_upgrade 'vim'
# brew_install_or_upgrade 'ctags'
# brew_install_or_upgrade 'tmux'
# brew_install_or_upgrade 'reattach-to-user-namespace'
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `mac` script for examples.

Laptop functions such as `fancy_echo`, `brew_install_or_upgrade`,
`gem_install_or_update`, and `brew_cask_install` can be used in your
`~/.laptop.local`.

```sh
# Go to your OS X user's root directory
cd ~

# Download the sample file to your computer
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/18F/laptop/master/.laptop.local
```
